# DisasterManagement
We are making our project under the category “AI for disaster management” . we will take pre and post sattelite images of disaster area. Aerial images (pre-disaster and post-disaster images) with same spatial information but different time series information regarded to landslide and flood are taken directly from Google Earth as input images. By using CNN (one maxpool layer and two fully connected layer) , we will predict the kinematics of the disaster and provide alertness to the nearest area. Disaster detection system proposed by our system consists of 2 phase; train phase and test phase.
